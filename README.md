Program to calculate time residence time and time delay in a first order plus time delay system

This program is pretty bad all things considered and could be greatly improved but it does the job. 

Comments explain the code.

There are 2 example excel files to show the right formatting and how the graph is supposed to look.

Might help with a certain PDC project.
